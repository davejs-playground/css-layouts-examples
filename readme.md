# CSS Layout Examples

Some examples to practice with and learn about making layouts with CSS. These
examples cover:
  - Basic layouts using the box model.
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid

## Setup

NOTE: Make sure you have the latest version (LTS) of Node installed before
beginning.

[Install Node](https://nodejs.org/)

If you're not sure if you have Node installed, run the command `node -v` in
Terminal/Command Prompt and it should return the version of Node you have
installed.

### Install Dependencies

1. In Terminal/Command Prompt, go to the project root directory:
`css-layout-examples`.
2. Run `npm install` (shorthand: `npm i`) to install dependencies.

### Run the Project

1. 1. In Terminal/Command Prompt, go to the project root directory:
`css-layout-examples`.
2. Run `npm start` to start the dev server.
3. Go to `localhost:7777` in any web browser to explore the examples.

NOTE: Some examples make use of newer features in CSS. It is important that
you've updated your browser recently in order to ensure all examples work as
expected. These examples were created using `Google Chrome Version 65.0.3325.181`
and `Firefox Quantum 59.0.2`.

## Practicing with These Examples

Each example has a START and FINISH version. The START versions have some setup
done for you and explain what changes are needed in order to complete the
example. If you follow the instructions correctly, you should end up at the
FINISH version (or something equivalent it).

When you make changes and save them, they will automatically appear in your
browser without having to refresh the page so you can focus on the code and not
constantly refreshing to see your changes.

## Acknowledgements

The dev environment setup and some styles for these examples was taken from
[Wes Bos's CSS Grid course](https://cssgrid.io) and some examples were inspired
by it. I strongly encourage you to check out the course. It's free, and has
great examples with video tutorials.

# CSS Layout Examples

Some examples to practice with and learn about making layouts with CSS. These
examples cover:
  - Basic layouts using the box model.
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid

## Setup

NOTE: Make sure you have the latest version (LTS) of Node installed before
beginning.

[Install Node](https://nodejs.org/)

If you're not sure if you have Node installed, run the command `node -v` in
Terminal/Command Prompt and it should return the version of Node you have
installed.

### Install Dependencies

1. In Terminal/Command Prompt, go to the project root directory:
`css-layout-examples`.
2. Run `npm install` (shorthand: `npm i`) to install dependencies.

### Run the Project

1. 1. In Terminal/Command Prompt, go to the project root directory:
`css-layout-examples`.
2. Run `npm start` to start the dev server.
3. Go to `localhost:7777` in any web browser to explore the examples.

NOTE: Some examples make use of newer features in CSS. It is important that
you've updated your browser recently in order to ensure all examples work as
expected. These examples were created using `Google Chrome Version 65.0.3325.181`
and `Firefox Quantum 59.0.2`.

Here are some resources I've used to learn about web layouts:

### Box Model

- CSS Box Model [[Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp)]

### Float Layouts

Probably just Google how to do stuff... Everything you find about float layouts is inherently going to be hacky (unless you're flowing content around text). :P

## Acknowledgements

The dev environment setup and some styles for these examples was taken from
[Wes Bos's CSS Grid course](https://cssgrid.io) and some examples were inspired
by it. I strongly encourage you to check out the course. It's free, and has
great examples with video tutorials.
